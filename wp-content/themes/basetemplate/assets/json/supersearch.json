Festivals are ongoing throughout the year all over the world and culminate to a major gathering in October every year on 14th street in NYC. AiOP has been one of the most rewarding  experiences of my career,and I think that shows in my work. I have worked with AiOP since 2010, starting with a redesign of the main site, then working on my first festival site, 2011 Ritual.  caption id= attachment_13  align= aligncenter  width= 675   14th and 1st, NYC  caption  2014 The Site The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don t know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I m breaking now. We said we d say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn t. Nature is lethal but it doesn t hold a candle to man. Your bones don t break, mine do. That s clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don t get sick, I do. That s also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We re on the same curve, just on opposite ends.
