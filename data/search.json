Festivals are ongoing throughout the year all over the world and culminate to a major gathering in October every year on 14th street in NYC. AiOP has been one of the most rewarding\u00a0experiences of my career,and I think that shows in my work.\r\n\r\nI have worked with AiOP since 2010, starting with a redesign of the main site, then working on my first festival site, 2011 Ritual.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_13\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"675\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-13\" src=\"http:\/\/careyestes.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/AiOP14th.png\" alt=\"Corner of 14th St. and 1st Ave, NYC\" width=\"675\" height=\"450\" \/> 14th and 1st, NYC[\/caption]","link":"http:\/\/careyestes.local\/aiop\/"},{"title":"Hello world!","content":"Welcome to WordPress.

It's different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:\n\n<blockquote>Hi there! I'm a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my blog. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi&#241;a coladas. (And gettin' caught in the rain.)<\/blockquote>\n\n...or something like this:\n\n<blockquote>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.<\/blockquote>\n\nAs a new WordPress user, you should go to <a href=\"http:\/\/careyestes.local\/wp-admin\/\">your dashboard<\/a> to delete this page and create new pages for your content.
